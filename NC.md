This file holds all the naming convention rule I will adhere to for the website

-	only use alphanumerical character plus underscore for all variable and database names. 
-	All class names start with a capital letter for codes.
-	All variable and file names will be unique with the assumption that not all system distinguish between letter cases. For example, if a “Student” class is created then “student” won’t be used for anything else.
-	Camel case or snake case will be used to show multiple words instead of spaces.
-	Versions of the projects will be stored in the following format “-v#x” Where #x is the version number.
-	Names will be made as short as possible without losing meaning. This may mean using a table to hold common abbreviation.
-	All number will be digits. So, 1 will put as 01, to help with maintain order in some systems.
